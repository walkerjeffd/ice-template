## About

This repository contains a starting template for building a new Interactive Catchment Explorer (ICE) application.

ICE is a web-based interactive data visualization framework for exploring environmental datasets and model outputs.

This template contains a working demo that presents two example datasets in order to demonstrate the proper file structures and formats.

The `Prerequisites` section of this README describes the software needed for development.

The `Quick Start` section provides basic instructions for running the demo.

The `Building a New Application` section walks through the steps necessary to adapt this application for new datasets.

Lastly, the `Build Process` section describes how to build and deploy the production version of the application.

NOTE: use and modification of this template requires experience in modern web application development, JavaScript programming, and the use of the various third-party libraries (specifically vue.js, d3.js, crossfilter.js, leaflet.js, among others).

## Prerequisites

To develop a new ICE application, you will need to install node.js (v12 or newer) as well as some global packages.

Instructions for installing node.js can be found at [https://nodejs.org/en/]().

After installing node, use the node package manager (`npm`) to install the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server).

```bash
npm install -g @vue/cli http-server
```

## Quick Start

Complete the following steps to run the demo application in this repo, which includes two example datasets.

### Project setup

Install dependencies defined in the `package.json` file.

```sh
npm install
```

### Run Development Server

To start a development server that runs the demo, run the `dev` command, which serves the `data/` folder at port `8000`, and runs the vue CLI `serve` command.

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/). This page should contain the demo application for the two example dataset (Northeast, Northwest).

## Building a New Application

This section describes the primary steps for adapting this template to new datasets.

### Step 1: Generate Themes

A `theme` in ICE contains the configuration, data, and geospatial data associated with a single dataset.

Each theme is comprised of the following files:

```
theme.json         - configuration file
data.csv           - CSV file containing the dataset
layer.json         - GeoJSON file containing the spatial features
features/<ID>.json - JSON files containing additional data for each individual feature
```

These files are organized by subfolders within the `data/` folder. The files for each theme must be stored within a subfolder named after the theme id (e.g., `data/northeast/` contains the files for the `northeast` theme).

#### theme.json

Each `theme.json` must contain attributes for the `id`, `label`, `description`, and `variables`.

```
{
  "id": "northeast",
  "label": "Northeast Example",
  "description": "Example dataset of the northeast U.S.",
  "variables": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

The `variables` attribute must be an array that defines a series of properties for each variable in the dataset.

Numeric variables must have the following format.

```
{
  "id": "variable1",         // must match column name in the data.csv file
  "label": "Variable 1",     // how the variable is displayed in the interface
  "description": "A dummy variable from 0 to 1",
  "units": null,             // units (optional)
  "type": "num",             // must be "num" for numeric variables
  "group": "Variable Group", // the group this variable belongs too (dropdown menus list variables by group)
  "map": true,               // true if this variable should be an option for the map variable
  "filter": true,            // true if this variable should be an option for the crossfilters
  "formats": {               // format specification for displaying values, see https://github.com/d3/d3-format#locale_format
    "value": ".1%",          // for writing a single value (e.g. tooltip)
    "filter": ".1%"          // for the crossfilter axis labels
  },
  "scale": {
    "domain": [0, 1],        // 2-element array defining min/max values of this variable
    "transform": "linear"    // transformation type, can be "linear" or "log"
  }
}
```

Categorical variables must have the following format.

```
{
  "id": "variable3",         // must match column name in the data.csv file
  "label": "Variable 3",     // how the variable is displayed in the interface
  "description": "A categorical variable", // additional description
  "units": null,             // null for categorical variables
  "type": "cat",             // must be "cat" for numeric variables
  "group": "Variable Group", // the group this variable belongs too (dropdown menus list variables by group)
  "map": true,               // true if this variable should be an option for the map variable
  "filter": true,            // true if this variable should be an option for the crossfilters
  "formats": {
    "value": null,           // null for categorical variables
    "filter": null           // null for categorical variables
  },
  "scale": {
    "domain": [ // domain is an array that maps each unique value in the dataset to a label (e.g., if variable3="A" then the value is shown as "Value A")
      {
        "value": "A", // value in data.csv
        "label": "Value A" // label for displaying value
      },
      {
        "value": "B",
        "label": "Value B"
      },
      {
        "value": "C",
        "label": "Value C"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### layer.json

The `layer.json` file defines the geospatial data (i.e., coordinates) of the spatial features using [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) format. This file must use the WGS84 (EPSG 4326) projection (latitude/longitude).

Each feature must contain a unique `id`, which corresponds to the `id` column in the `data.csv` file.

Note that in this starter template, ICE is only configured to render point geometries. However, alternative geometries (polylines, polygons) could be supported by modifying the render functions within the `src/components/IceMapLayer.vue` component.

```
{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "name": "layer",
  "crs": {
    "type": "name",
    "properties": { "name": "urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:1.3:CRS84" }
  },
  "features": [
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": "170501090104",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [ -117.939631420651409, 42.590973510329043 ]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "Feature",
      "id": "170501041304",
      "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [ -116.674185426499221, 42.454648318749527 ]
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

#### data.csv

The `data.csv` file contains the theme dataset in comma-separated values (CSV) format. Each row contains the values for one spatial feature, and each column represents a different variable. This table must include a column named `id`, which corresponds to the `id` field of the GeoJSON layer. For each of the other columns, the `theme.json` file must contain a variable definition with the `id` attribute equal to the column name (see above).

```
id,variable1,variable2,variable3
170501090104,0.24387659435160458,0.2369458530249091,B
170501041304,0.6368760853074491,1.877845762558082,B
170402080305,0.7774140483234078,-0.1166326835861824,A
170402100904,0.05460463068448007,0.6259004795984403,A
170501041305,0.21677141194231808,-1.0887155657567542,A
170402060805,0.9966927575878799,-0.06722108592500253,C
...
```

#### features/ID.json

Lastly, the `features/` subfolder within the theme contains a collection of files, one for each unique spatial features. Each file must be named using the `id` of the corresponding feature (same as the `id` column in `data.csv` and the `id` attribute in the `layer.json` file).

Each file must be in JSON format, and all files should have an identical structure. The purpose of these files is to provide all data associated with a each feature. This may include data that is not part of the `data.csv` (e.g., timeseries).

In the demo application, each feature details file simply contains the values of the three variables as well as the feature id.

```
{
  "id": "010100020101",
  "variable1": 0.6696,
  "variable2": 0.1116,
  "variable3": "C"
}
```

Whenever a feature is selected on the map, the corresponding details file will be loaded and made available to the theme component (see next section).

### Step 2: Create Theme Components

For each theme, create a new vue component in the `src/components/themes/` folder. This component is used to display the details of a selected feature in the right-hand side bar when a feature is clicked and the corresponding feature details file (`data/<theme>/features/<id>.json`).

For the demo datasets, each component (`src/components/themes/Northeast.vue` and `src/components/themes/Northwest.vue`) simply provides a pair of tables listing the values of each variable. However, these components can be enhanced to include other data and charts. For more complex examples, see the [walkerjeffd/ice-lmg](https://github.com/walkerjeffd/ice-lmg) source code.

The name of each theme component must be a CamelCase version of the theme id (e.g., `northeast -> Northeast.vue` or `my-dataset -> MyDataset.vue`).

### Step 3: Themes List

The list of available themes is stored in the `src/assets/themes.json` file. This file must contain an array of folders. Each folder has an `id` and `name`, as well as an array of `children`, which contain the themes for that folder. Each theme must have an `id`, `name`, and `description`. Remember that the theme `id` must match the name of the folder in `data/` containing the files for that theme.

```
[
  {
    "id": "project",
    "name": "Example Projects",
    "children": [
      {
        "id": "northeast",
        "name": "Northeast Dataset",
        "description": "Example dataset of the northeast (Region 01)"
      },
      {
        "id": "northwest",
        "name": "Northwest Dataset",
        "description": "Example dataset of the northwest (Region 17)"
      }
    ]
  },
  ...
]
```

### Step 4: Content

Lastly, update the text content in the various dialog boxes as well as the application title in the `App.vue` file.

### Step 5: Run Development Server

Once the files and components for the themes have been created, run the development server to view the application.

```sh
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](). This page should contain the application with your new themes.

## Build Process

The following steps describe how to build the production version of the application.

### Step 1: Configuration

Build configuration is set using `.env` files for each environment (`development`, `production`). See [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/mode-and-env.html) for details.

There are two required configuration variables:

```
BASE_URL=/                              # root path for the application
VUE_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/  # location for fetching data
```

The `BASE_URL` variable defines the initial URL path of the application when it is deployed to the server. For example, if the target URL is http://example.com/app/ice/ then set `BASE_URL=/app/ice/`.

The `VUE_APP_API_URL` variable defines the root URL where the data will be stored, which may differ from where the application files are deployed. For example, if the data are accessible at http://example.com/data/ice/theme-id then set `VUE_APP_API_URL=http://example.com/data/ice/`.

The default `.env` files can be overriden with `.local` variants (e.g. `.env.development.local`), which are not tracked by the repo.

For production, create a new `.env.production` (or `.env.production.local`) file and define the `BASE_URL` and `VUE_APP_API_URL`.

### Step 2: Production Build

Run the `build` command to build the application for production. This command will bundle all of the application files, and write the output to the `dist/` folder. The contents of this folder can then be copied to the remote web server.

```sh
npm run build
```

### Step 3: Deployment

After building the application, copy the contents of `dist/` and `data/` to the production server.

```sh
rsync -av --delete dist/ user@host:/path/to/app
rsync -av --delete data/ user@host:/path/to/data
```

If the application is deployed to S3, use the AWS CLI.

```sh
aws s3 sync dist/ s3://<WEBSITE_BUCKET_NAME>/<BASE_URL> --delete
aws s3 sync data/ s3://<DATA_BUCKET_NAME>/ --delete
```
